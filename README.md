# webScraper
This program used scrapy to parse a bitcoin news aggregator website for daily bitcoin news sorted by hour every day for the past two years. 

These articles were then converted into objects which stored the article date, url, and body. the objects are then organized by date and sent to the market sentimant program. 


To sum up, this was me doing my best not to pay for news API data. 

Mostly succesfully I might add.
